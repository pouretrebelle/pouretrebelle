I made this profile README just to admit that my _stunning contribution streak_ is because [chareads.com](https://chareads.com) [re-deploys every night](https://github.com/pouretrebelle/chareads.com/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml#L93) so the YouTube views and comments stay up to date, and it counts as a contribution because the site is hosted from the `gh-pages` branch. I'm a fraud ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Also hi :wave: I'm [Charlotte](https://charlottedann.com), a designer/developer/maker based in London. I make cool computer jewellery at [Hexatope](https://hexatope.io), cool generative-art jigsaws [@abstractpuzzles](https://instagram.com/abstractpuzzles), and I also work at [Farewill](https://farewill.com) as an engineer.
