I made this profile README just to admit that my _stunning contribution streak_ is because [chareads.com](https://chareads.com) [re-deploys every night](https://github.com/pouretrebelle/chareads.com/blob/main/.github/workflows/nightly.yml) so the YouTube views and comments stay up to date, and it counts as a contribution because the site is hosted from the `gh-pages` branch. I'm a fraud Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯

Also hi :wave: I'm [Charlotte](https://charlottedann.com), a creative technologist based in Brighton ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. I work on GitHub's Design Infrastructure team as an engineer and I make [generative jigsaw puzzles](https://abstractpuzzl.es) for fun.
